# Change Log

## [Unreleased]
[Full Changelog](https://github.com/jasonish/evebox/compare/0.5.0...0.6.1)
- Upgrade to Angular 4 and Angular CLI 1.0 and use its AOT compilation
  feature reducing the Javascript size even further. Combined with
  response compression, initial data loaded by the browser is about
  7-8x less.
- Compress HTTP responses speeding up initial load times.
- New "oneshot" mode - a mode where EveBox directly reads in an
  eve.log file into an SQLite database for one time viewing, then
  cleans up after itself.
- The EveBox server can now process an eve file without an agent
  (basically an embedded agent), storing the events in Elastic Search
  or SQLite
- When using Elastic Search 5.2+, use the update_by_query API to
  archive and escalate events. This should speed up archiving.
- Fix Elastic Search keyword handling when Filebeat is used to send
  eve logs directly to Elastic Search.
- Reports:
  - In addition to the event views, there are now some report views.
- EveBox Agent:
  - The EveBox agent is a replacement for Filebeat and/or Logstash. It
    can read Suricata eve log files sending them to the EveBox server
    which will then store them to the configured data store (Elastic
    Search or SQLite).
- SQLite Support:
  - SQLite can now be used as a backend. This is suitable for smaller
	installations where event load is light.
  - Reports are currently not supported with SQLite.
- If the agent is being used to submit events and the datastore is
  Elastic Search, create a template if one doesn't already index for
  the configured index. For Elastic Search 2.x and Logstash 2 template
  is used, for Elastic Search 5.x and Logstash 5 template is used.
- A start on some documentation:

## 0.5.0 - 2016-06-17
[Full Changelog](https://github.com/jasonish/evebox/compare/0.4.0...0.5.0)
- EveBox is now runs as a server instead of just some static files
  that use the browser to connect directly to Elastic Search. This
  will allow:
  - Simple setup and dealing with CORS.
  - A platform to provide new features and other database options
    moving forward.

  (Only in Suricata git builds as of now).
